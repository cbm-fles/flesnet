/**
 * The ItemWorker protocol
 *
 * Each worker ("ItemWorker") connects to the broker ("ItemDistributor"). The
 * worker starts the communication by sending a REGISTER message. After that,
 * the broker can send a WORK_ITEM message at any time, and the worker can send
 * a COMPLETION message at any time. In addition, the broker sends HEARTBEAT
 * messages regularly if there is no outstanding WORK_ITEM. This allows the
 * worker to detect that the broker has died, in which case the worker closes
 * the socket and opens a new connection.
 *
 * The broker keeps track of all connected workers. It detects that a worker has
 * died by the disconnect notification. When this happens, it releases all
 * outstanding WORK_ITEMs for that worker and stops sending messages to it.
 *
 * The REGISTER message contains a specification of the type of items the worker
 * wants to receive (stride, offset). It also specifies the queueing mode.
